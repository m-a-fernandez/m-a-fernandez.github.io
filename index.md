### CPSC 120


* Lab 3


Lab 3, part 1 was one of my favorite labs this semester. I found it really interesting how we applied mathematical concepts to the code. Even though we were using math in this lab, the work itself was still fairly simple and understandable, and a great way to learn how to use equations in c++.


* Lab 6


Another lab that I enjoyed was Lab 6, part 1. It was very useful to learn how to take command line arguments, and return them to the user in an answer. I feel like lab 6 was the foundation of utilizing command line arguments and was simple enough for me to comprehend.
